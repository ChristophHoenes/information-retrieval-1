### RankNet ###

### LambdaRank ###
To start the fine-tuned model, simply run `lambda_net.py` as the main function.
If hyperparameter tuning should also be done, comment in the call for `hyperparameter_search()`

If you want to change the hyperparameters of the model, alter the respective variables at the beginning of the main.
